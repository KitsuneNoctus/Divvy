Dates 3/16-3/25

**My Name:** Jessica Trinh


**Project Name:** Divvy


**Is your project New or Old?** Old


**Is your project Solo or Team?** Team


## Description

**Write a paragraph summary of the current status of your project, what you hope to achieve during the intensive, how and why**

Currently Divvy's prototype and MVP is functional, I would like to continue to reiterate on it so that it may have the quality and polish needed to ship to the app store. 


## Challenges I Anticipate

**List out the challenges you anticipate for completing this project**

- implementing web scraper into iOS framework 
- knowing when it's truly app store ready 
- time limit/scoping 
- working 100% remotely from my teammate 

## Skateboard

**ONE SINGLE aspect of product. Consider: build backend for SPD 1.2 front end, CRUD one resource, use API or library, authentication etc.**

**Start coding and finish “Skateboard” feature before beginning “Bike”.** 

Be able to CRUD items in marketplace 

## Bike
**ONE additional features that get you closer to your idealized product. Examples: CRUD 2nd resource, add comments, API use, authentication, library use** 

Use Firebase for Chatoom feature 

## Car
**ONE additional feature** 

Work out kinks in web scraper and implement the web scraper API into the iOS framework

## Personal Achievement Goals:

**Each teammate must achieve 2 of 3 of their self-set personal achievement goals. If you're not on a team, delete the other teammate sections as needed.**

### Teammate 1: Henry Calderon 

1. refactor marketplace to be of app store quality 
2. create cart feature for items to be added to 
3. proper display/dismissing of views
